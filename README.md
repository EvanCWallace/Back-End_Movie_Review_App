# Back-End_Movie_Review_App
For this project, you will build an application using everything youâ€™ve learned so far in the Back-End Career Path. Unlike the previous projects, what you build is up to you. We will provide some ideas to get started but we want this project to be something that you are passionate about building.


# Project Requirements:
Build the application using Node.js and Express
Persist data for your application using a PostgreSQL database
Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
Use a project management tool (GitHub Projects, Trello, etc.) to plan your work
Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project including:
Technologies used
Features
Future work
Any other relevant documentation for people to use your app
Write unit tests for your service methods
Document your back-end API with Swagger
Authenticate users to manage their access to parts of the application
Host your app online so users can access it from a URL
Handle errors gracefully and return clear response codes
OPTIONAL: Create a front-end that adds a user interface to your API
OPTIONAL: Get a custom domain name and use it for your application
OPTIONAL: Set up a CI/CD workflow to automatically deploy your application when the master branch in the repository changes
